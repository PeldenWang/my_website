  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <img src="../assets/Images/profilepic2.jpg" alt="" width="400">
<p>Hello, I'm Pelden Wangchuk and I work as a web developer. I have been working as a web developer for quite some time now. I believe I am a very ambitious person who loves to work on making the website work well. Working on the web is my passion as I love to work on exciting projects.</p>

<p>What do web developers do? In short, we build and maintain websites.

  I often work for clients who are trying to get their product or service onto the web. The work is typically very project focused and involves collaborating with a team that helps to coordinate the clientâ€™s needs into the end product. The client could be a tech company, an organization, or a government. The work could involve front-end, back-end, or full-stack web development.
  
  Web development is a good profession for me if you like solving logical problems, building useful things, and experimenting with new technologies.</p>
